💱 Currency Exchanger (JavaScript DOM Project)

A clean, beginner-friendly currency exchanger built using vanilla JavaScript, focused on DOM manipulation, API handling, and clear separation of UI and logic.
No frameworks. No libraries. Just fundamentals done properly.

What This Project Demonstrates

This project was built to practice and demonstrate:
• DOM selection and manipulation
• Dynamic creation of <option> elements
• Event handling (change, click)
• Working with asynchronous JavaScript (async / await)
• Fetching and using data from an external API
• Basic input validation
• Clean separation of data, logic, and UI

Small project. Strong JavaScript fundamentals.

🛠️ Tech Stack
• HTML5 – structure
• CSS3 – layout and styling
• JavaScript (ES6) – logic, DOM control, API calls

No external libraries or frameworks used.

🌐 API Used

Currency Exchange API
https://latest.currency-api.pages.dev/v1/currencies/

• Free to use
• No API key required
• Uses lowercase currency codes

Flags API
https://flagsapi.com/{COUNTRY_CODE}/flat/64.png

• Used to display country flags dynamically

⚙️ How the App Works (DOM Logic Explained)

The entire application is controlled using JavaScript DOM manipulation.

• Currency dropdowns are populated dynamically from a countryList object
• Each dropdown listens for change events
• When a currency changes:
• The corresponding country code is retrieved
• The flag image is updated dynamically

Amount Validation
• Empty, zero, or negative values are rejected
• Default value is set to 1 to avoid invalid calculations

⸻

Currency Conversion Logic

• The selected “from” currency is used to fetch exchange data
• Exchange rates are extracted from the API response
• The selected “to” currency rate is applied
• The converted amount is calculated and rounded
• The result is displayed dynamically without reloading the page

Example output:
1 USD = 109.35 BDT

📁 Project Structure

• index.html – markup
• style.css – styling
• script.js – logic and API handling
• countryList.js – currency-to-country mapping

📌 Notes

• This project is intentionally simple
• Focus is on understanding how JavaScript works with the DOM
• Designed for learning, practice, and extension

Free to use for learning and experimentation.
